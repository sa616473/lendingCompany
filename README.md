# Defining The Problem

#### Can we predict the right loan applicant from their background?

Through loans many people can pursue their future education or buy a home, car, favorite furniture or anything they like that will bring joy and happiness to them and their family.
- **But the most important question is who is going to pay back?**. 
- **How can a bank identify the right candiate apart from someone who is trying to scam the bank?** 
- **Can AI help us with this problem**

#### Goals
- Help lending club make the right decision when giving out loans.
- Help the right applicants to recive loans.

## Discovering the Data

- Missing data in percentage

mort_acc    |            9.543469
emp_title   |            5.789208
emp_length   |           4.621115

As we can see the mort_acc has the most missing data so we looked at the <br/>
**correlations** based on **mort_acc** and imputed the missing values with <br/>
the **total_acc** features median value.

#### Data Visualization

-- **Imbalance of the data plot**

- As we can see in the following plot we have more positve data compared to negative data this natuaral in this scenario because the companies that are lending money usally lend to people that they think will most likely pay back.

![count plot loan status](/reports/figures/graphs/png/loan_status_count.png)

-- **Correlation plot using heat map**
- Some basic visualization to check out the correlations

![correlations plot](/reports/figures/graphs/png/corr.png)

-- **count plot of grade F and G**
- Taking a closer look at the loans that usally default

![F and G](/reports/figures/graphs/png/sub_grade_count.png)

### Developing Solutions

#### Establishing the Baseline
- We used the Grade feature to predict our baseline model. Our base model by default predicts 0 for grade F and G
- With this model we acheived a accuracy of 80%
-- **Baseline confusion matrix**
![Baseline Confusion Matrix](/reports/figures/graphs/png/baseline_confusion_matrix.png)

#### Machine Learning Models
- Hypothesized models
- **XGBoost Classifies** with hyperparameter tuning
- **Densely connected Neural Network(DNN)** with Bayesian optimization
- **Densely connected Neural Network(DNN)** with hand tuning Hyperparameters

### Best Model
- Our Best models for now:
